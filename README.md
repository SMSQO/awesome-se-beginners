# awesome software engineering beginners

- ## Introduce
  主要涉及本组研究，智慧学习及学习者辅助研究为主。围绕GitHub，Stack Overflow等开源社区进行用户、代码、仓库、依赖库等问题进行数据挖掘和分析，尚未发表的工作不在列。
  - curation list : repositories of reserach for software engineering learners, most work based on GitHub and Stack Overflow
  - repositories marked with * established by our lab
  - This repository mainly stores research for beginners of software development, mainly including papers, codes and open source systems, including some data used in the analysis process. The project owner is the researcher, including undergraduate and graduate students.

- ## repositories list

  - *https://github.com/delavet/SOworkspace
    - An API learning Service designed for inexperienced developers. Powered by StackOverflow, Wikipedia, Javadoc, etc
    - ICWS 2021
  - *https://github.com/zhouyuqi1492/GHTRec-Service
    - The implementation service of ICWS paper: GHTRec：A Personalized Service to Recommend GitHub Trending Repositories for Developers, aiming to recommand topics that users may link to their repositories.
    - ICWS 2021
  - *https://github.com/Vremold/LinkSO
    - A weakly supervised approach to link Stack Overflow posts to programming language textbooks. Mainly rely on matching in 3 extracted features: keyphrase, semantics and code elements
  - *https://github.com/Vremold/DLS/
    - This work is mainly to mine structured and unstructured functional semantic information from existing front-end open source repositories, and provide retrieval services for user queries based on this.
    - ICSS 2022 best paper
    - NCSC 2022 compitition 
      - https://github.com/quackson/Semantical-Library-Retrieval frontend project.
  - *https://github.com/Git-JK/A-Retireval-System-Based-on-the-Functional-Semantics-of-Stack-Overflow-Posts
    - This repo is mainly the code implementation of the undergraduate thesis of JK. The main idea is to use verb phrases and phrase patterns to extract the explicit functional semantics contained in the title of the question and answer post, and use Bert based bertlets model to extract the implicit functional semantics contained in the question description and answer of the question and answer post, And match the explicit and implicit functional semantics of the question to be queried, so as to recommend stack overflow Q & A posts.
  - *https://github.com/Harris-pku/graduation_design
    - Chinese question answering community retrieval system
  - *https://github.com/quackson/cn_blogs-analysis
    - This repo is a study of cnblog, a Chinese technology community. It uses graph method to model and classify Chinese Blogs.
  - *https://github.com/quackson/springbootApiUsageCase
    - This study is mainly a case search study for springboot beginners, and the data is from GitHub open source data. The algorithms used are mainly graph kernel and spectral clustering.
    - NCSC 2021
